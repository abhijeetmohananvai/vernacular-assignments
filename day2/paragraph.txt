Embedded clusters are groups of very young stars that are partially or fully encased in an Interstellar dust or gas which is often impervious to optical observations. 
Embedded clusters form in molecular clouds, when the clouds begin to collapse and form stars. 
There is often ongoing star formation in these clusters, so embedded clusters may be home to various types of young stellar objects including protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. 
An example of an embedded cluster is the Trapezium Cluster in the Orion Nebula. In œÅ Ophiuchi cloud (L1688) core region there is an embedded cluster

The embedded cluster phase may last for several million years, after which gas in the cloud is depleted by star formation or dispersed through radiation pressure, stellar winds and outflows, or supernova explosions. 
In general less than 30% of cloud mass is converted to stars before the cloud is dispersed, but this fraction may be higher in particularly dense parts of the cloud. 
With the loss of mass in the cloud, the energy of the system is altered, often leading to the disruption of a star cluster. 
Most young embedded clusters disperse shortly after the end of star formation
